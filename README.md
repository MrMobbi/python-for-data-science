## Introduction

This repository is a learning-focused project designed for those who want to get hands-on experience with Python in data science contexts.
The modules are sequentially structured to introduce core concepts, starting from basic Python syntax to more advanced programming patterns.
The primary tools explored in this project include **Pandas**, **DataTable**, and various **Object-Oriented Programming** techniques,
all aimed at building practical skills in data management and manipulation.

## Modules

### Module 0: Starting
In this introductory module, we cover the basics of Python programming. Topics include:
- **Python syntax and structure**: Understanding how Python code is organized.
- **Data types**: An overview of fundamental data types such as integers, floats, strings, and lists.
- **Control structures**: Using loops and conditional statements to control program flow.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable blocks of code.

By the end of this module, you should be familiar with writing and running basic Python code, preparing you for data manipulation and analysis tasks.

### Module 1: Array Manipulation
This module focuses on using the **Pandas** and **NumPy** library, a crucial tool in data science, to manipulate data. Topics include:
- **DataFrames and Series**: Creating and working with Pandas and numpy core data structures.
- **Data loading and saving**: Loading data from CSV, and other file formats.
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and transforming data.
- **Data analysis**: Using Pandas for filtering, grouping, and summarizing data.

This module provides a solid foundation for data handling and is essential for anyone working with large datasets in Python.
